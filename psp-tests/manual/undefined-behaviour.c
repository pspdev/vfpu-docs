// Delay slots have a significant amount of undefined behaviour. Check it here.
// Summarizing: Branches in delay slot seem to always be the branch taken (so
// the first branch is disregarded) with one exception: when the first branch
// is conditional and the second one is not.

// A possible explanation is that jumps are executed one cycle earlier than
// branches. This is backed by the jump to jump latency being 3 cycles and
// the conditional branch latency being 4 cycles. The CPU likely requires
// the branch to go through the ALU/EXEC stage (to compare the registers)
// whereas the jump only requires a register read (for JR) or nothing at all
// (for j).
//
// So two branches with the same latency are executed, the second one "wins".
// In case of jump+branch, the branch also wins, since it executes later too.
// For the only exceptional case (branch+jump) the branch takes precedence,
// likely due to both branches trying to change the PC during the same cycle
// (likely ALU/EXEC for the branch and RF/REG for the jump). We assume that
// "older" instructions "win".
